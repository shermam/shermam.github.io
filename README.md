## Hi! I am Shermam Miranda

I am a software developer. I graduated in IT at the Newton Paiva Colege in Belo Horizonte, MG - Brazil in 2013.

Since the I have worked with these backend languages:

- Java
- C#
- Node JS
- PHP

And with these frontend languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

I have also worked with some frameworks like Angula JS, Angular and Bootstrap.

Althoug in the past I have worked with desktop applications, nowadays I try to focus in developing responsive web applications that usually comunicate with a RESP api in the backend.

I really like to be up to date with the newest web technologies. And I love to learn new things.
I mainly use github to store my toy projects. These projects usually are exemples of technologies that I am learning, or ideas that I would like to try to implement.

Ahmm, and I also like to play a lot of chess and play musical intruments. And I try to use my developer skills to try and do some new things related to that.

If you share some of the same interests, or have some interesting related ideas that you would like to share, please contact me.
