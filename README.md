## Hi! I am Shermam Miranda

I am a software developer. I graduated in IT at the Newton Paiva College in Belo Horizonte, MG - Brazil in 2013. I also like to play a lot of chess and play musical intruments. And I try to use my developer skills to do some things related to that.

If you share some of the same interests, or have some interesting related ideas that you would like to share, please contact me.
